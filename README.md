# Project Log-Analysis

### Project Overview
>In this project, you'll work with data that could have come from a real-world web application, with fields representing information that a web server would record, such as HTTP status codes and URL paths. The web server and the reporting tool both connect to the same database, allowing information to flow from the web server into the report.You have to give the answer of three questions.Questions are as follows.
>1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
>2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
>3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

### How to Run?

#### PreRequisites:
  * [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
  * [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
  * [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

#### Setup Project:
  1. Install Vagrant and VirtualBox
  2. Download or Clone [fullstack-nanodegree-vm](https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm) repository.
  3. Download the [data](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/August/57b5f748_newsdata/newsdata.zip) from here.
  4. Unzip this file after downloading it. The file inside is called newsdata.sql.
  5. Copy the newsdata.sql file and content of this current repository, by either downloading or cloning it from
  [Here](https://github.com/mvcman/Log-Analysis)


#### Launching the Virtual Machine:
  1. Launch the Vagrant VM inside Vagrant sub-directory in the downloaded fullstack-nanodegree-vm repository using command:

  ```
    $ vagrant up
  ```
  2. Then Log into this using command:

  ```
    $ vagrant ssh
  ```
  3. Change directory to /vagrant and look around with ls.

  ```
    $ cd /vagrant
  ```

#### Setting up the database and Creating Views:

  1. Load the data in local database using the command:

  ```
    psql -d news -f newsdata.sql
  ```
    The database includes three tables:
     * The authors table includes information about the authors of articles.
     * The articles table includes the articles themselves.
     * The log table includes one entry for each time a user has accessed the site.

  2. Use `psql -d news` to connect to database.

  3. Create view request_error using:
  ```
    create view request_error as select date(time),count(*) as error_count from log where status!='200 OK' group by date;
  ```
  ```
     |  Column     |  Type  |
     | ------------+--------|
     | date        | date   |
     | error_count | bigint |
  ```


  4. Create view total_request using:

  ```
    create view total_request as select date(time),count(*) as t_request from log group by date;
  ```
  ```
     |  Column   |  Type  |
     |-----------+--------|
     | date      | date   |
     | t_request | bigint |
  ```

  5. Create view percentage using views request_error and total_request using following command:
  ```
    create view percentage as select request_error.date,round((100.0*request_error.error_count/total_request.t_request),2) as percent_error from request_error,total_request where request_error.date=total_request.date;
  ```
  ```
     |  Column      |  Type   |
     |--------------+---------|
     |date          | date    |
     |percent_error | numeric |
  ```
  6. To comes out from the database use ` \q `command:



#### Running the queries:
  1. From the vagrant directory inside the virtual machine,run logs.py using:
  ```
    $ python logs.py
  ```
#### Information about log.py file:

  1. Function in logs.py file

       >get_query_result(query)---To get all query results.

       >print_articles_query_results(query_result)---To print articles query result.

       >print_author_query_results(query_result)---To print author query result.

       >print_error_query_results(query_result)---To print error query result.

       >dict()---To store {} (curlibraces) in variables. Like query_1_result = dict() To create array.
